##Assignment2.1

#Task 2.2.1: Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of integers
# representing the lengths of the corresponding words.
# Hint: â€‹If a list [ ab,cde,erty] is passed on to the python function output should come as [2,3,4]
# Here 2,3 and 4 are the lengths of the words in the list.

def word_to_integer(mylist):
    list1=[]
    for word in mylist:
        list1.append(len(word))
    print(list1)
    
word_to_number_map = {"ab","dfr","wfgdwfgdfg","jk","jkgh"}
word_to_integer(word_to_number_map)
